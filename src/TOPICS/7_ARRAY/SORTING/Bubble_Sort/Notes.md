##  BUBBLE SORT
1. `n` elements in an array ->`(n-1)` passes
2. After every pass we need to apply `Bubble Sort ` on the unsorted element only and need to check the `Largest`
3. Max no of swaps in worst case ib Bubble Sort -> `(n*(n-1))/2`
4. We can optimize the Bubble Sort in the case of nearly sorted array with the help of `Checkmark`
5. #### Time Complexity :
    - Best Case: O(n)
    - Worst Case : O(n^2)
    - Avg Case : O(n^2)
6. #### Space Complexity :
  - All Cases : O(1)
7. Outer Loop : Passes
8. Inner  Loop : Swapping 
9. After every pass `Max number` will be in the top right hand position for Ascending Order

### Note : It is an stable sorting
