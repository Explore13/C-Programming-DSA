## Insertion Sort

1. Iterate over the array from the second element to the last element.
2. For each element, compare it with the previous elements in the sorted subarray.
3. If the element is smaller than the previous element, swap them and continue comparing with the previous elements until the element is in its correct position.
4. Repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

## Time Complexity :
- worst case : `O(n^2)`
- avg. case : `O(n^2)`
- best case : `O(n)`
### Note : It is an stable sorting
